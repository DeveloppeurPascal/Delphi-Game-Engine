# Delphi Game Engine

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

FireMonkey is the cross-platform component and library framework provided with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). It allows to develop native (= compiled) software for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux from a single code base.

As this framework is based on a graphics engine it is ideal for developing 2D and 3D video games without learning how to use a specialized game engine (like for example the great [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io) which also includes many tools (map editors, sprites, ...) for Pascal game developers).

This code repository offers reusable units and examples for your video game projects.

It comes from years of game development for fun and [live coding sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) started in 2021 (and a long time before Twitch).

You can find examples of classic game features in [Delphi FMX Game Snippets](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets) if you are looking for inspiration.

A presentation of FireMonkey's "game engine" features was offered at [DelphiCon 2021](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com/) (in English, see [the replay](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com/talks/using-firemonkey-as-a-game-engine-on-demand/)) and [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) on Saturday, December 11, 2021 at 3pm (in French, see [the replay](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/p/_200p-webinaire-du-11-decembre-2021-utiliser-firemonkey-comme-moteur-de-jeu-video.html)).

Some of [my Delphi games](https://gamolf.fr) are open sourced on GitHub. Find them as submodules of [this repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Games-Pack).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Install

To download this project you better should use "git" command but you also can download a ZIP from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine).

**Warning :** if the project has submodules dependencies they wont be in the ZIP file. You'll have to download them manually.

This project depends on :

* none

If you want to use game controllers features for iOS or macOS, don't forget to add the GameController framework to your SDK(s) in Tools/Options/Deployment/SDK and refresh the files.
