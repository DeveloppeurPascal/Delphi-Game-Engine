# FMXGameEngine

FireMonkey is the cross-platform component and library framework provided with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). It allows to develop native (= compiled) software for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux from a single code base.

As this framework is based on a graphics engine it is ideal for developing 2D and 3D video games without learning how to use a specialized game engine (like for example the great [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io) which also includes many tools (map editors, sprites, ...) for Pascal game developers).

This code repository offers reusable units and examples for your video game projects.

It comes from years of game development for fun and live coding sessions on Twitch started in 2021.

You can find examples of classic game features in [Delphi FMX Game Snippets](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DelphiFMXGameSnippets) if you are looking for inspiration.

A presentation of FireMonkey's "game engine" features was offered at [DelphiCon 2021](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com/) (in English, see [the replay](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com/talks/using-firemonkey-as-a-game-engine-on-demand/)) and [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) on Saturday, December 11, 2021 at 3pm (in French, see [the replay](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/p/_200p-webinaire-du-11-decembre-2021-utiliser-firemonkey-comme-moteur-de-jeu-video.html)).

If you are not familiar with Delphi and the Pascal language, take advantage of the Academic Edition (for students, teachers and educational institutions) or the Community Edition (free for personal use) available at Embarcadero (under the heading "free tools").
You can also test Delphi in your company with the evaluation version.

Online French conferences and webinars (technical points on specific topics) are organized regularly. Check out [the schedule for these webinars](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/p/_6007-webinaires.html) and watch [Delphi webinar replays](https://serialstreameur.fr/webinaires-delphi.php) or [Embarcadero Technologies YouTube channel]() for other languages.

Live coding sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or [the Pascal Developer YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk_LmkBB90jdEdmfF77W6qQ) are also organized regularly. For Twitch you can check [the weekly schedule](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin/schedule). You can also refer to [this article](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/p/_600e-livestreams-de-codage-en-direct-avec-delphi.html). For replays of all this, just go to the [live coding section](https://serialstreameur.fr/live-coding.php) of [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/) where you will find many videos in French for software developers, mobile applications, websites and video games.

Finally, if you prefer reading to video, you can find all the recent books published on Delphi and the Pascal language at [Delphi Books](https://delphi-books.com)
