# Delphi Game Engine

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

FireMonkey is the cross-platform component and library framework provided with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). It allows to develop native (= compiled) software for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux from a single code base.

As this framework is based on a graphics engine it is ideal for developing 2D and 3D video games without learning how to use a specialized game engine (like for example the great [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io) which also includes many tools (map editors, sprites, ...) for Pascal game developers).

You'll find more game engines in Pascal (Delphi, Lazarus, ...) listed on [Awesome Pascal](https://github.com/Fr0sT-Brutal/awesome-pascal).

This code repository offers reusable units and examples for your video game projects.

It comes from years of game development for fun and [live coding sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) started in 2021 (and a long time before Twitch).

You can find examples of classic game features in [Delphi FMX Game Snippets](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets) if you are looking for inspiration.

Some of [my video games](https://gamolf.fr) are open sourced on GitHub. Find them as submodules of [this repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Games-Pack).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* none

If you want to use game controllers features for iOS or macOS, don't forget to add the GameController framework to your SDK(s) in Tools/Options/Deployment/SDK and refresh the files.
